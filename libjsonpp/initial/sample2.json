The series revolves around five young Anabaptist adults who move to New York City in order to experience a different life and to make a difficult decision regarding whether to return to their communities, or to remain outside their old communities and face potential ostracism by their family and friends. It follows the cast members as they experience life in New York and face new situations involving work, friendship, romance, and lifestyle, plus the drama that develops between cast members as they undergo various experiences.\n\nThe cast-members' move to New York City differs from Rumspringa, the rite of passage in which some 16-year-old Amish are allowed to experience the outside world and to decide whether or not they wish to remain with their home communities.\n\nIn February 2013, TLC ordered a second season of Breaking Amish. On April 3, 2013, TLC confirmed this was not a second season but a spinoff, Breaking Amish: Brave New World, starring the original cast members starting their lives in Sarasota, Florida, home to a large ex-Amish and Amish community. The second season, subtitled as Breaking Amish: Los Angeles, premiered on July 21, 2013.",
